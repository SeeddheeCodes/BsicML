# Steos to create a ML model

-  Formulating the Question
-  Finding and Understanding the Data
-  Feature Engineering
-  Choosing a model
-  Predict an output is a logistic regression
-  Classify an output is a classification model
-  Tuning and Evaluating

# Type of Learning
- Supervised Learning  - We give the input and desired output
- Unsupervised Learning - We give data and the model observes some patterns and gives an output. (clustering)


## Supervised Learning

### Regression
    -   Outputs are continuous
    -   Outputs can be flexibly defined

### Classification
    -   Used to predict a discrete label
    -   Binary/Multiclass // Multilabel

# Measuring Model Accuracy: Distance Formulas (How far off are we from the actual Output)

Distance depends on the context
- Euclidean Distance
- Manhattan Distance
- Hamming Distance


To find the distance between two points
- Points can be multi dimensional
- T0 find the distance between two points the should be in the same dimension
