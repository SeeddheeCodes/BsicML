# Steos to create a ML model

  Formulating the Question
-  Finding and Understanding the Data
-  Feature Engineering
-  Choosing a mode
-  Predict an output is a logistic regression
-  Classify an output is a classification model
-  Tuning and Evaluating


- Supervised Learning  - We give the input and desired output
- Unsupervised Learning - We give data and the model observes some patterns and gives an output. (clustering)
